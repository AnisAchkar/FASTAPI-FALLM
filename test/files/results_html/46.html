<body><div><h1>User question:</h1><p>What improvements can be made to Task 1?</p></div><div><h1>AI answer:</h1><p>According to the provided document, some of the improvements that can be made to Task 1 are: 
- No more Conversational retrieval chain 
- Query transformation multi-query 
- Strong memory 
- HTML formatter for code and text 
- Retrieve the documents being used as well as the context 
- Code with the idea in mind that we need to re-create the same logic for Azure cog search later on - create classes 
- Input and output are conform to future input and output 
- Memory works well [3]. So if I ask the chatbot about an old question, he is supposed to answer me.
- Text output formatting: The format of the code is similar to chatGPT 
- The format of the text is well organized for better understanding (highlight, bullet points, underline )
- The format of the text includes references that point to the reference numbers [3]. 
- The models answer are accurate 
- The code works well on Azure function. [3]. </p></div><div><h1>Sources:</h1><p>{'document': 'Clement task 1.pdf', 'similarity': 1.8849762678146362, 'content': 'multi-query \n\nstrong memory \n\nhtml formatter for code and text \n\nretreive the documents being used as well as the context \n\ncode with the idea in mind that we need to re-create the same logic for azure \ncog search later on - create classes \n\nWHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE\n Input and ouput are conform to future input and ouput \n\n Memory works well.
